- Complete FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL + Redis caching
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes configurations/deployment
- Real-time data preprocessing pipelines (50% faster testing)
- ESP32 firmware with WiFi connectivity and cloud upload
- SCD30 sensor integration (hardware troubleshooting needed)
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
Note: SCD30 I2C communication blocked - investigating library compatibility vs hardware issue"
